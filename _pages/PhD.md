## Description 
The Climate Dynamics Lab (CDL) at Northeastern University invites applications for 1 Ph.D. position in large-scale climate dynamics beginning in fall 2026. The successful candidate will be supported to design research projects within the broad themes of climate modeling and dynamics. The project will use an interdisciplinary research approach that combines a hierarchy of climate models, isotope-enabled modeling, statistical and machine learning techniques, and observations/paleoclimate proxies, aiming toward a better understanding of the physical processes that govern climate change and variability in the past, present, and future. Potential project areas include, but are not limited to, 

* driver of multidecadal climate variabilities and their impacts (such as AMV, PDO/IPO) in the present and future, 
* mechanisms of regional and global surface temperature variability in the paleo, 
* large-scale air-sea interactions, 
* and explainable machine learning to uncover new dynamics in monsoon patterns.

The selected candidates will have the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in the Northeastern, NCAR, WHOI, and other world-class universities in Boston and USA. The candidates will have the opportunity to mentor and learn from current and future lab members.

The CDL values productive collaboration and a respectful, inclusive work environment. We welcome applicants from diverse backgrounds, especially those with majors in 

* atmospheric and oceanic science, 
* applied math, 
* computer science, 
* or related disciplines. 

We are seeking ideal candidates who have research experience, a passion for learning and scientific exploration, and a commitment to equity and inclusion. While an M.S. is preferred, it is not required. Proficiency in Python, MATLAB, or Julia is required. A positive attitude and the ability to work both independently and part of a team are required. Candidates from historically and currently marginalized groups are particularly encouraged to apply.


## Funding 
The position will be funded on research and teaching assistantships for up to five years. Students will be supported and encouraged to apply for university and national fellowships, where Northeastern has a successful track record. The position offers a competitive stipend, tuition waiver, health insurance benefits, and annual funding for attending academic conferences and workshops.
