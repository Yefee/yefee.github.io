I am a climate scientist and paleoceanographer dedicated to understanding the mechanisms driving climate and ocean change.
I earned my Bachelor’s degree from the School of Geographic and Oceanographic Sciences[https://sgos.nju.edu.cn/] at Nanjing University[https://www.nju.edu.cn/] in China, where I conducted a research project of paleocenography, funded by NSFC undergraduate program. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences[https://cos.northeastern.edu/nucos-department/marine-environmental-sciences/#:~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Marine%20and%20Environmental%20Science%20prepares,biodiversity%2C%20our%20air%2C%20and%20certainty%20for%20our%20future.] at Northeastern University[https://www.northeastern.edu/]. 
My previous research focused on the evolution of marine key biogeochemical element cycles since the Last Glaciation. Currently, my work centers on the mechanisms underlying interhemispheric thermal contrasts across multiple timescales. In my research, I integrate a hierarchy of model simulations, instrumental observations, geochemical proxies, and data assimilation to better understand the coupled climate–ocean system.
