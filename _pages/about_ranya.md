Hi! I’m an undergraduate at Northeastern University pursuing a B.S. in Data Science and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, currently a sophomore. I’m passionate about using data to explore environmental systems, especially our oceans and the deep sea. I’m really interested in how we can use data to learn more about our planet and its changing climate.
