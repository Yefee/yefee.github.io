## Postdocs
---
Our lab is always looking for postdocs in climate dynamics and paleoclimate at Northeastern. Opportunities are contingent upon pending fundings. I am also open to discussing both internal and external fellowship opportunities from [Northeastern's Future Faculty Fellowship](https://faculty.northeastern.edu/advance/faculty-recruitment/future-faculty-fellowship-2/), [NOAA](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc), [NSF](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/atmospheric-geospace-sciences-postdoctoral), and [McDonnell Foundation](https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/).

## Graduate Students
---
Our lab is seeking graduate students to join my lab at Northeastern in Fall 2025. Prospective students with similar research interests are strongly encouraged to apply. Graduate students will primarily be supported through research assistantships, but I am also open to discussing opportunities for external fellowships from [NASA FINESST](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/future-investigators-in-nasa-earth-and-space-science-and-technology-finesst-2/), [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [DOE CGSF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/), and [AMS](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/information-for/students/ams-scholarships-and-fellowships/ams-graduate-fellowships/).

The application deadline is **December 1, 2025**. See more details of the application [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/PhD).



Please email me the following information if you are interested. Note that sending these documents does not constitute a formal application.



- A short writeup to explain your research interests, why you are interested in joining, and your experience working with programming/climate/statistics/physcis;

- Your most recent CV, including contact information for three references;

## Undergraduate Students and Masters
---
If you are a master's or undergraduate student interested in gaining research experience in our lab's focus areas, please email me.

Undergraduates are also encouraged to apply for Northeastern's [PEAK Awards](https://undergraduate.northeastern.edu/research/) and [AJC Merit Research Scholarship](https://undergraduate.northeastern.edu/research/awards/ajc-merit-research-scholarship/), as well as extenral scholarships from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/office-education/hollings-scholarship), [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/), and [AMS](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/information-for/students/ams-scholarships-and-fellowships/women-in-science-scholarship/).
