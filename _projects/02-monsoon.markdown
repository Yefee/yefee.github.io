Monsoons, which are characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons and a seasonal reversal of prevailing winds, are a planet-scale atmospheric phenomenon that affects nearly two-thirds of the world's population. My research is to improve our understanding of monsoon dynamics and future projections by investigating past changes in global monsoon variability. I focus on the following questions: (1) How does the global monsoon respond to external forcings, such as greenhouse gases, ice sheets, changes in Earth's orbit, vegetation, and aerosols? (2) How can we interpret associated paleoclimate proxies (e.g., speleothem $$\delta ^{18}O$$) from the past? 

I conducted the first set of isotope-enabled transient climate experiments (iTRACE) during the last deglaciation (20,000-11,000 years ago) using a state-of-the-science isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model (iCESM) (He et al., 2021, Sci. Adv.). This was the first time that the deglacial water isotope and hydroclimate evolution in the Asian summer monsoon was quantitatively reproduced in simulation. The success of my simulation shows the deglacial water isotope in Asian monsoon system was driven by water source in the upstream Indian Ocean, while the rainfalls in different regions were regulated by local atmopsheric circulations. This provides a possible solution to reconcile the water isotope-hydroclimate paradox in the Asian monsoon â€” a longstanding grand challenge in paleoclimate. Another follow-up study (He et al., 2021, Nat. Commun.), for the first time, emphasized the importance of the Autumn monsoon in shaping the deglacial East Asian hydroclimate and has stimulated follow-up studies.
